# Horiseon Social


## Description 

This is a static web page for a fake social marketing company called _Horiseon Social_ that I modified for my first homework assignment in the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. I refactored the page with HTML semantic elements and increased accessibility generally. Additionally, I re-structured the HTML and CSS and made some minor improvements including fixing a nav bar link, adding a favicon, and creating horizontal rules between the sidebar content.


## Usage 

Just go to this link to see the awesome page I refactored!
